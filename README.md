# Arduino Uno Raindrop Sensor 

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes an Arduino Uno and a raindrop sensor to detect rainfall. It reads the analog output from the sensor and prints a message to the Serial Monitor indicating whether rain is detected based on a predefined threshold.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Raindrop Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Raindrop Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the analog output of the raindrop sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Ensure the sensor's VCC pin is connected to +5V and GND to GND on the Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the raindrop sensor to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the output on the Serial Monitor, which will indicate "It's raining!" when the sensor detects rain above the defined threshold.

#### Applications

- **Weather Monitoring:** Use for detecting rainfall in weather monitoring systems.
- **Automated Systems:** Implement in automated systems to trigger actions based on rainfall detection.
- **Gardening:** Monitor soil moisture levels for automated watering systems.

#### Notes

- Adjust the `rainThreshold` variable based on your sensor's calibration and environmental conditions.
- Ensure the sensor is positioned correctly to detect raindrops effectively.
- Customize the code to integrate additional features such as data logging or real-time alerts as needed.
